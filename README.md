my projects in my journy in this nanodegree.


Project 1 : getting insights from Malaria in Africa Dashboard

Project description

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, weâ€™ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.


Project 2 : Analyze NYSE Data

For the final project, you will conduct three tasks: 1) complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings, 2) develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement, and 3) create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming which sub-category and company you want to focus your data analysis on - the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to conduct your analysis and choose a sub-category and company you are most interested in. This project is open-ended in that there is no one right answer.



Project 3: Query a digital music store Database




Projcet 4: Data Visualization using Tableau

Project Description

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets you can choose from.

    Flight Delays and Cancellations >> i chose this one.
    US Census Demographic Data
    Youtube Data from the US

1) Flight Delays and Cancellations

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

The file you must use in creating your data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.

You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:

    Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?

    Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but you may choose an alternative visual to provide this information. Think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.

    What causes delays?

    Think about if you work at an airline and you want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?

    You can also come up with your own question!

    As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.
